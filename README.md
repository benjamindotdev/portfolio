## 🛠️ Development Notes

### PWA Icons
The manifest currently references `icons/icon-192x192.png` and `icons/icon-512x512.png` for Progressive Web App installability. To create proper icons:

```bash
# Using ImageMagick (if available)
convert your-logo.png -resize 192x192 -background black -gravity center -extent 192x192 public/icons/icon-192x192.png
convert your-logo.png -resize 512x512 -background black -gravity center -extent 512x512 public/icons/icon-512x512.png

# Or use online tools like:
# - https://realfavicongenerator.net/
# - https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
```

Current placeholder icons are copies of `favicon.ico` and should be replaced with properly sized PNG images for optimal PWA experience.
